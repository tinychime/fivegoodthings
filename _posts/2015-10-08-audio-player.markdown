In January 2012, we had our first gathering to figure out what we wanted out of the music and arts scene in Richmond. Packed in a tiny apartment, we started planning what would eventually become Subterranea. In the months since that first meeting, Subterranea has taken a lot of different forms. We've been a jumping off point for bands to reach a different crowd, we've given out of town folks a resource for booking shows in the city, and we've provided a hub online for people to see and hear our art. That being said, we're proud to announce the new Subterranea.

Since the beginning, we've tried to figure out how to better represent different types of art through Subterranea. Until now, we've had trouble deciding how to share the biproducts of our music. That's something we're always working to do and the new Subterranea gets us one step closer to that goal.

SubterraneaCollective.com will continue to be a hub for the best under-noticed music in Richmond, but from now on, you'll be able to find so much more than that.

This space is evolving every day and we want to give the most sincere thanks to everyone who has been a part of this so far. Wether you've come to a show, written an article about us, or collaborated with us in some way, we deeply appreciate it and hope you'll stick around for a while longer.
