Hey y’all! This week’s issue is a quickie. Read on and then get out there and enjoy your Sunday afternoon.

### 1. Pagan Parties 🔮

While it’s true I spend most of my free time making webstuff & writing this newsletter, I do have other hobbies. About 35% of my down-time is devoted to tweeting at celebrities and I spend another 15% browsing my go-to source for [horoscopes](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/virgo), shamanism & all else occult, Broadly.

Late Thursday night, I came across [this video](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/video/stonehenge-stoners-and-worshipping-wizards-12-hours-at-the-worlds-biggest-pagan-party) in which Broadly correspondent [Callie Beusman](https://twitter.com/cal_beu) was sent to Stonehenge to experience the world’s biggest pagan party. There were druids, shamans (not “shamen,” as I was surprised to learn), lots of drunk teenagers, vaping, praying & protests; all of the elements of an amazing celebration.

### 2. Summer Jams 🔥
Now that the air has disappeared and been replaced by actual fire, I’m ready to submit to an endless wash of guitar sounds until the leaves change. The timing for [Young Scum](https://twitter.com/young_scum)’s new album Zona couldn’t be any better. Yesterday, the temperature hit 97° and Zona just felt right. Everything from the arrangements to the melodies sound like [that one really great Hellogoodbye record](https://open.spotify.com/album/2UDXi4I3LCNUSEEofQd76x) if it were recorded in 2016 by a buncha’ Southern Boys.

[IndieCurrent is streaming it on their website for the next few days](http://fivegoodthings.cmail19.com/t/d-l-iyhlktl-hultudjhl-d/). Check it out there while you can & [go give them some money for it on Bandcamp](http://youngscum.bandcamp.com/album/zona).

### 3. Feelings 😵
[Sam Alden](https://twitter.com/samalden) is a [writer and storyboard artist](http://gingerlandcomics.com/) on Adventure Time whose work I’ve been following for a while. You can trace every great moment in Adventure Time to one of it’s creators side projects. The show definitely has it’s own voice, but it’s obvious to me that the writers leave a little bit of themselves in each episode. [Check out this comic written by Sam & published by Hazlitt a few days ago](http://hazlitt.net/comics/test-loyalty). It’s a dystopian (but not incredibly far-fetched) take on immigration, and it has that signature Sam Alden weirdness that has shown up in a few of my favorite episodes of Adventure Time.

### 4. Projection 🎶
PWR BTTM are a very special band. I’ve seen them four times in the last 12 months and just bought tickets to see them again in November, so the crush is pretty serious. Ben and Liv have traveled the country [creating safe spaces for their fans](http://fusion.net/story/273245/pwr-bttm-gender-neutral-bathroom-policy/) and generally being fantastic. Zane Lowe premiered a brand new song of theirs on his Beats 1 show on Apple Music earlier this week. Honestly I had trouble focusing on the song after hearing Zane Lowe say PWR BTTM so many times, but [luckily they released it a few hours later on Bandcamp](http://pwrbttm.bandcamp.com/track/projection).

"Projection is a song about feeling unqualified to be the way you see yourself because of the way other people see you, and how other people's perception of your identity can warp your sense of self. It's about being exhausted with the pressure of fitting in and throwing a shiny, glorious middle finger to those who doubt you."

### 5. Shamelessness 🏆
We don’t deserve Eric Andre. He paid a visit to the RNC, thoroughly bothered everyone in attendance (while risking life & limb) and [filmed the whole thing](http://fivegoodthings.cmail19.com/t/d-l-iyhlktl-hultudjhl-p/). I’ll leave it at that.
