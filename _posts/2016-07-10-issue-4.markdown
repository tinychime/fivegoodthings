JK. I just wanted to see if the fear of Witch Magic was enough to get more of you to open this thing.

A lot has happened since I sent the last issue of Five Good Things. Black people in this country are experiencing an epidemic of bigotry, racism and police violence that plainly shouldn’t be happening in 2016. I considered not sending an email this week. Truth be told, researching and writing issue <span>#4</span> served as a much-needed break from a truly exhausting week of news coverage and I hope it does the same for you.

Before we get going with this week’s Good Things, I thought I’d give you a couple of ideas for ways to help right now from your phone or computer:

1. [Contact your Senator](http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) and remind them how important it is that they prioritize police reform in your state. Yes, it’s all over the news, but if we don’t keep their inboxes *quite literally full* of our letters telling them that they’re doing a bad job, they might not ever start doing a good job.

2. If you have it, [donate to the Black Lives Matter Organization](https://donate.idex.org/checkout/donation?eid=66399). Their website is having some capacity issues for obvious reasons, but keep trying. [After what happened last night](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeDeray?src=tren&data_id=tweet%3A752168944602054656), it’s clear that leaders of the movement are being targeted specifically.

3. Above all, stay safe. Call your people and let them know you care about them.


### 1. Bent Pop 🌀

My people (or my constant, feverish Google searching) tell me it’s a bad idea to give you folks too many things to click in these emails. They say you’ll get overwhelmed and unsubscribe. That sounds like bullshit to me but I guess I have more confidence in your attention span than the average email marketing blogger.

It only took four issues, but here we are; a list within a list. I promise I’m committing this reprehensible crime for for a worthy reason. A couple of months ago I saw this Canadian band called Weaves perform at the Tiny Desk & just immediately fell in love with everything about them. After having some trouble finding the right way to describe Weaves, I read somewhere that they like to describe themselves as “bent-pop,” and I’m on board with that. What I do know is that they sound incredibly familiar, but I haven’t heard these parts in quite this order before.

The Tiny Desk was published a few weeks ago and flew under my radar until a friend of mine posted it on Facebook. The next 4–6 hours are a bit of blur. I fell into a music discovery black hole and came out on the other end feeling a little weird and having formally adopted Weaves as my new favorite band.

**1.1** First, [check out Weaves’ Tiny Desk performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faGzVf9ySmY). They obviously had to rein it in a little bit volume-wise, but I think that accented some little quirks in the songs that don’t come through as clearly on their record.

**1.2** The way this band improvises seems to make every performance of each of their songs uniquely special in some way. For that reason, I feel comfortable including two different performances of the same song in this list. At about 2:40 in [this performance of Coo Coo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNOx8s4d-tw&feature=youtu.be), they move into this furious, joyous bridge that didn’t make an appearance in the recording and it’s everything to me.

**1.3** Lastly I think you should check out this [delightfully strange music video for Tick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IMTvbw7Uo4&feature=youtu.be) starring Toronto comedian Chris Locke. <!-- more -->


### 2. Outdoors 🌳

It’s a balmy 91° here in D.C. and normally when it’s that hot outside, I have no use for it. Typically I would just spend the weekend listening to records, drinking stupid amounts of iced coffee & writing this email, but this Sunday is different. I plan to spend a large portion of it walking around the city with my face buried in my phone trying to catch Pokemon. The great part about sending an email newsletter like this is that I don’t have to deal with the disappointed look on your face right now.

While I embarrass my wife in public, you should check out some dissenting opinions and choose a side. The first is [this piece written by frequent NPR.org contributor & Pop Culture Happy Hour panelist, Glen Weldon](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2016/07/08/485078495/gotta-catch-em-all-or-at-least-a-few-a-pokemon-neophyte-tries-pokemon-go). He starts out as a total novice and from what I can tell, he’s a a convert by the end of his adventure. The second is a [fairly scathing (& hilarious) criticism from producer & rapper El-P](http://pitchfork.com/news/66702-el-p-drops-pokemon-rap-after-insulting-pokemon-fans-launches-remix-challenge/?mbid=social_facebook); one half of Run The Jewels.

Best of luck to you all.


### 3. Emails 📬

Maybe you’re not here because you like email newsletters, but that’s one reason I’m here and this is my party so whatever I say goes. I’ve only received one issue of Meanwhile, but as a person who draws for a living & enjoys books, it’s really doing it for me. [Daniel Benneworth-Gray](http://danielgray.com/) designs book covers by day and in his free time publishes (semi-regularly) a list of links about books & design. Pretty simple.

You can [read a recent issue on the Meanwhile archive](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=e48b498e80c278078bd4069e6&id=479354d8ab&e=a1966004ab) and subscribe to the newsletter on [Daniel’s website](http://danielgray.com/meanwhile). Check it out or I swear to god, I’ll turn the lights on and send everyone home.

### 4. Instructions 👆

Considering that a large portion of you (my subscribers) found Five Good Things via Twitter, I have to assume that many of you have Twitter accounts. I scrolled past [@WikiHowArt](https://twitter.com/WikiHowArt) earlier in the week and cackled for a good 20 minutes before scrolling back up and (enthusiastically) following. I’ll leave it at that.

### 5. Memories 🔮

As we move through life, it’s important that we keep records and artifacts of what’s happened so we can remember where we’ve been. I would keep a physical journal, but I haven’t seen a piece of paper in over 5 years; so you’re going to have to settle for a Spotify playlist. Every time I mention a band I’m listening to, a song I really love, or anything having to do with music, [I’ll add it to this playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/jshosbrn/playlist/6OF7Y9lN6i5q72GhCpkJ4g?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open). I can assure you that I’m only bringing you the 🔥 hottest shit possible 🔥 so it’s a guaranteed win if you pop this baby on shuffle at your next dinner party.

Until next week,

— Josh
