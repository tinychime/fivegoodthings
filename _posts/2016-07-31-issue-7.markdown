I spent all of the time I was supposed to spend writing this introduction reading the [Wikipedia page for the number 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_(number)) üòû. So now while I know all there is to know ([and there's quite a lot out there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)), you have to settle for this pathetic intro.

Remember last week when I asked you guys to forward this email to your friends? Lot's of you did that!! Let's try it again. Forward this email to as many friends as you can, add a little message telling them why they should subscribe (make sure to CC [orb@fivegoodthings.club](mailto:orb@fivegoodthings.club) so I know you did it) and you'll be automatically added to ~*my list*~. Every one of your friends that subscribes to the newsletter will also be added to ~*my list*~. I'll have a cool surprise for all of you in a few weeks!!!

### 1. Disruption

Do you harbor dreams of Soylent fueled pitch meetings and micro-dosing before your interview with Tech Crunch at the frisbee golf course? It‚Äôs a tough life, but someone has to be a startup founder. Now [thanks to this (fully funded) Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frnsys/the-founder-a-dystopian-business-simulator), you too can feel what it‚Äôs like to live on the other side.

The Founder is a dystopian startup simulator being created & kickstarted by [Francis Tseng](https://twitter.com/frnsys), a [designer, developer & data scientist](http://frnsys.com/). I always enjoy seeing what Francis is working on because after all of the off-the-wall ideas I‚Äôve seen come from him, they still defy my expectation. Given that it‚Äôs a Kickstarter project, there‚Äôs no telling when the game will be playable by backers. I suggest you back it now and plant the seed for a nice surprise in a few months.

### 2. Pretty Words

Yesterday I had the apartment to myself and finally broke down and watched the first five episodes of Netflix‚Äôs Stranger Things. The internet wasn‚Äôt kidding; everything about this show is good. The cast is amazing, it‚Äôs gorgeous to look at, the sound design is unique; there‚Äôs a lot to love. Above all else I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the typography in that opening sequence. [Sara Gless wrote a great article analyzing the type design](https://blog.nelsoncash.com/the-typography-of-stranger-things-e35771f40d31#.lwc4u1vma) and I think there‚Äôs something in there for designers & non alike.

### 3. Side Projects

Ok I don‚Äôt want to be that guy who uses his email newsletter annoyingly promote his side projects, but bear with me. The honest truth is that I would‚Äôve probably talked about this amazing project even if I weren‚Äôt one of the participants. [David Rygiol](http://www.rye-jol.com/) and [James Louis Walker](http://www.husbandmen.com/) are two Impressively Accomplished Graphic Design Professionals and they‚Äôve asked me to contribute to a very cool project honoring National Parks in the United States.

Y‚Äôall might not know this about me, but I draw pictures for a living. There‚Äôs [a little more to it than that](http://josh.graphics), but for the purpose of this Good Thing, that‚Äôs all you need to know. Over the next few weeks I‚Äôll be creating a piece that pays tribute to Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. David & James have asked 58 other designers to contribute as well and [the list of designers](http://typehike.com/) includes some of my actual design heroes. [Follow along on my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joshosbrn/) to check in on my progress and [follow Type Hike on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/typehike/?hl=en) to see art from the other participating designers!

### 4. Justice üé∂
You may have heard [this insane story about Zara‚Äôs blatant theft of the intellectual property of about 20 designers this year](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/07/tuesday-bassen-on-her-work-being-copied-by-zara.html). Tuesday Bassen, a personal favorite artist & designer of mine, has been kind of a figure head for this movement against Zara, but others have started to join in as well. [Adam J. Kurtz](https://www.instagram.com/adamjk/?hl=en) launched [Shop Art Theft](https://twitter.com/shoparttheft), an online store where you can buy the original products that Zara copied. Have at it ‚úåÔ∏è.

### 5. Euphoria
Usually I like to spend some time with an album before I recommend it to a friend; doubly so when I decide to talk about it here. Late last night I discovered an album called [Stay Gold by a pop artist called Neon Bunny](https://neonbunny.bandcamp.com/album/stay-gold) from Seoul. When I woke up this morning I thought I‚Äôd give it another listen to see what of my love for Stay Gold was caused by sleep depravation. It‚Äôs not quite the legendary record my brain told me it was last night, but it‚Äôs quite good and I think you‚Äôll enjoy it.
