Hi! Omg you made it!!! This is exciting.

I've been thinking a lot over the last two weeks about what I should say to the people who gave me their email addresses with such abandon. Surprised by the response to my call for subscribers, I have to admit that I stressed quite a bit about this first issue.<!--break--> You answered my cry for attention with real attention and that's kind of scary!

If you're worried that you've given your contact information to a sociopath, I have good news for you; Five Good Things isn't about my voice. I'm dedicated to bringing other voices and perspectives to this conversation. That means both yielding authorship to others as often as possible, as well as listening to the feedback of you, my readers. When I write an issue I'll probably use my pedestal to lazily connect abstract ideas to music I'm currently listening to (see below). I can assure you that my friends are much cooler than I am and they have a bunch of stuff they really want to talk to you about. My hope is that each new issue of Five Good Things will offer something you weren't expecting, from someone who has something to say.

Ok, enough SeriousBusiness™, let's get to it:

### 1. Sundays ☀

Sundays are good for three reasons.

**A. Church bells —** When I hear church bells ring through my window first thing Sunday morning, something comes over me. I’ve never been a religious man, so as you can probably imagine, I feel simultaneously guilty & holy. For the past month, mornings like this have been accompanied by Chance the Rapper's amazing new record Coloring Book. Remember earlier when I mentioned that I'd try to connect abstract ideas to my very opinionated taste in music? This is one of those. [Take a listen to my favorite song from the album; How Great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmgLiU28us "How Great by Chance The Rapper on Youtube"). If you're not a gospel fan, stick with it through the intro! You're in for what I consider to be one of the most stunning hip hop songs of this decade so far.

**B. Hopeless love —** On Sundays I get to check in on [my favorite television romance](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RmxG5hRq2_Y/VzpecDO8isI/AAAAAAAAAcc/bAfEH_TlOCk5wlIlOZTPR3gH3SvBp_xiwCKgB/s1600/BrienneXTormund.jpg "heart-eyes-emoji").

**C. Self-congratulation —** The first issue of Five Good Things (that's me) was released to the surprise and chagrin of it's subscribers (that's you). This thing will show up in your inbox just about every Sunday for the foreseeable future, so buckle-in.


### 2. Collaboration ⚭

Collaboration is a good thing (2/5 to be exact). Some of my favorite moments in music were a product of an unexpected combination of forces between two artists.

Bad Bad Not Good is a Canadian jazz group that started their career doing instrumental covers of hip-hop songs. Lacking a vocalist, you could say they're built for collaboration. Here, they team up with Sam Herring of Future Islands. You might know him as the guy who [danced his way into our hearts on Letterman while singing one of the catchiest songs of 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK4lD3Uf8_o "Seasons by Future Islands on Youtube"). They really click on the first cut from Bad Bad Not Good's new album IV. It's called Time Moves Slow and I really think you're going to like it.

I could go on about this track but I realize this is an email and you're probably jogging or some shit so I'll leave it at that.

<div class="footnote">Go listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zmIrFDksUM">Time Moves Slow</a> on Youtube while you read the rest of the issue. You might hate it, but the beautiful thing about email is that I'll never know. The risk here of <a href="http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/__pr/GIC/TWIG__WoW/2013/41-fremdsch_C3_A4men.html">fremdschämen</a> is acceptably low.</div>

### 3. Steve Harvey Doesn't Want To Host Family Feud Anymore ☹

Steve Harvey and the demented team at [Super Deluxe](http://www.superdeluxe.com "Super Deluxe's website") have in common the ability to pinpoint a perfect moment of absurdity and distill it for human consumption.

&#42; This is my issue and I reserve the right to share links to silly Youtube videos. I get all of the benefit of sending you the link, and none of the embarrassment when you don't find it as funny as I do. &#42;

### 4. Three Word Phrase

Ryan Pequin is an illustrator who does storyboards for my cartoon-of-choice, [Regular Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDge3-JsJ0A "Regular Show on Youtube"). In his spare time, he makes an incredibly funny web comic called Three Word Phrase. It's one of my all-time favorite things on the internet. Some of them are NSFW so if your baby or your boss is looking over your shoulder, don't click just yet.

... all clear? Ok.
