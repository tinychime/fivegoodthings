This is going to sound bonkers but.. I'm writing to you from the past. 13 hours in my future (your present) I'll be in a car on the way to beach. In a few short hours I'll be drunk, sandy & just a little bit annoyed. The beach and I don't always agree. A few hours in and I'm typically regretting my decision to vacation and falling into a deep beach nap / fever dream. This intro definitely isn't about me, but one more thing about me:

✨✨✨

I'd like to now speak directly to my future self: Josh, we both know you're arrogant enough to read your own email newsletter, so while I've got you here, I wish you the serenity to make it through another beach trip. For the next three days you'll probably stay mildly buzzed in an attempt to forget how much you hate sand. No one blames you for that; do what feels right. 

✨✨✨

Now that that's taken care of, let's get back to your present and my past.

### 1. Patience 🔄

If you’re anything like me you’ve sacrificed your family, your job and everything you love to keep up with the [Frank Ocean live stream](http://boysdontcry.co/) all week. I was really hoping I'd be able to share a new Frank album with you today, but like so many times before, I was let down. Instead, I had to watch someone cut, sand, paint and weld nothing for forty hours and I have even less to show for it.

Earlier this week some brave soul sifted through hours of footage from the live stream and recorded all of the music. What we now have is over an hours' worth of really [beautiful ambient & contemporary orchestral music](http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/hear-all-the-music-in-frank-oceans-livestream.html?mid=twitter_vulture) that I can only assume is an attempt to calm us all down.

### 2. Oh No 🙃

Ok I was originally going to write about a really good, new daily webcomic by [Alex Norris](https://twitter.com/dorrismccomics) called [Webcomic Name](http://webcomicname.tumblr.com/), but just before I was about to start writing this Good Thing, I realized I didn't know much about Alex. After some Googling™ I found Norris' [main website, Dorris McComics](http://dorrismccomics.com/).

Instead of being a Smart Person and just finding Alex's bio and moving along, I let myself get fully sucked into the Dorris McComics archive. There are a million (1,000,000) hilarious comics and drawings on there so go check it out n0w.

### 3. Micronesia 🇫🇲

OHey Matt Lauer, that was a rude thing you did during the Olympic opening ceremonies, man. Uncool. You're a very attractive guy, but your [insensitivity toward the Federated States of Micronesia](http://indianexpress.com/sports/rio-2016-olympics/opening-ceremony-commentator-comic-quip-michael-phelps-india-2957494/) has you one misstep away from [winding up on my dunzo list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acLp0S3K6mk). In case you missed the opening ceremony, Lauer said something to the effect of, "We COULD skip them, but we wont.." 

Ok Matt, yes we were all very excited to see the American olympians walk down the.. thing or whatever on television, but the delegation from Micronesia seemed SO EXCITED to be there. They just looked so happy and they came ALL THE WAY from Micronesia and this is how we treat them? I don't even have a link for this I just want to give a shout out to Micronesia. Keep being you.

### 4. Clarity 😌

GUCCI BACK. I've seen a lot of music bloggers mockingly insinuate that Gucci Mane was replaced by a cold (brr), robot-like imitation during his stay in prison. [New Yorker's feature on Gucci](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/08/the-reinvention-of-gucci-mane) seems to capture Gucci's story more accurately than most have over the last couple of weeks.

### 5. Tennis 🎾

Last summer around this time I fell in love with a bonus track from [Tennis' album Ritual In Repeat](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ybAN3utgdoUL1MUCtH4QM) called [Mean Streets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-Y0rML2bZs). It's this really sultry, bouncy, faux-'50s pop song that I would've probably dismissed if not for how impressive the execution was. The piano is jangly, the rhythm section sounds well rehearsed but loose, and the vocal melodies are sickly-sweet (in a really nice way).

Yesterday Spotify told me to listen to a new single from Tennis called [Ladies Don't Play Guitar and god damnit they've done it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn4Sh-tmmxE). The same elements that really drew me to Mean Streets are all present, but they seem to have changed decades; Ladies Don't Play Guitar is a sluggish disco slow-burner. Praise to Tennis for making their way back into my life at the perfect time. ✌️
