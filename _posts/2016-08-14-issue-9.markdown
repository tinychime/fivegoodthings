No major events in the news or email newsletter milestones to quip about this week folks. Instead, I'll share with you [this Internet Screenshot that made me cry yesterday](https://twitter.com/annahulkower/status/763816127902482432).

### 1. SCIENCE ‚öó

Speaking as someone who listens to many hours of public radio each year as a part of my job, I feel that I've become particular about the voices that I enjoy hearing. Wendy Zukerman, host of Science Vs. checks all of my 'radio personality' boxes. Science Vs. is a new podcast from Gimlet that "... takes on fads, trends, and the opinionated mob to find out what‚Äôs fact, what‚Äôs not, and what‚Äôs somewhere in between." It's made up of the same funny, high quality audio storytelling I've come to expect from Gimlet, but I feel like I've learned something new every time I listen.

[Check out this absolutely infuriating episode on fracking](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/fracking/) and then binge the rest of the episodes because they're that good.

### 2. Comebacks üå≥

Two days ago, at his Eaux Claires music festival in Wisconsin, Justin Vernon & his band performed a whole album's worth of new Bon Iver music. I've had Friday, August 12th on my calendar ever since [this arcane video teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUtg4kFscUw) was posted on Bon Iver's Youtube channel about a month ago because deep down I felt that it was time for a Bon Iver album announcement.

There lives in my heart a place for Justin Vernon. Along with a truly magical group of musicians from bands like Collections of Colonies of Bees and All Tiny Creatures, he wrote and recorded one of my all time favorite albums. [Repave by Volcano Choir](https://open.spotify.com/album/589MwkeuVyR5wMAMP07ARA) is the kind of album that I'll put down for months and when I finally come back to it I wonder why I've been listening to anything else. It's my musical safety blanket.

Everything about 22, A Million feels completely cryptic. Bon Iver's music has always lived in a world of really beautiful and well considered visuals, but there's something [supremely odd and wonderful about the glyphic style](https://twitter.com/joshosbrn/status/764308296496926720) used to create the videos and art released so far. Vernon's puzzle-like lyrics have become increasingly more difficult to solve over the years and that trend continues with "[22 (OVER S‚àû‚àûN)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISCEilPMNak)," and "[10 d E A T h b R E a s T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNy7VtSsmu8)," the first two songs released since the album's live premier. I need to spend a lot more time with these songs, but I'm so happy to have something new to decode.

**Bonus:** [Pitchfork sent a few writers to Eaux Claires and they live tweeted the Bon Iver performance from Friday night](http://pitchfork.com/news/67499-bon-iver-debut-new-album-in-concert-live-blog/).

### 3. Johnny Slack üòÆ

Sometimes you need to take a break from the endless horror that is the internet and pay attention to something beautiful for a few minutes. Stop arguing with your racist aunt on Facebook, [spend some time with Johnny Slack](http://www.johnnyslack.co/).

Note: For the best Johnny Slack viewing experience, make sure you're in a dark room with headphones on. Hell, go fullscreen; you deserve it.

### 4. Friends üë¨

Remember that music festival I talked about earlier in the newsletter? As Eaux Claires drew to a close last night, Francis & the Lights brought Chance the Rapper & Justin Vernon on stage for [a performance of Friends](http://pitchfork.com/news/67537-chance-the-rapper-bon-iver-join-francis-and-the-lights-at-eaux-claires-watch/?mbid=social_twitter).

The lore behind this song can get a little confusing, but I'll try to explain. Francis (of Francis & the Lights) produced a song called [Summer Friends from Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book](https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper/summer-friends-feat-jeremih-francis-the-lights). We all know Coloring Book and how amazing it is, but what we didn't know was that Francis, in producing Summer Friends, sampled his own song (Friends). I personally love scouring tweets and liner notes to figure out connections between songs like this, so I'm passing those savings on to you.

### 5. Reminders üêò

Shouts out to Erick Arjaluoto for [this blog post](http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/never-surrender/?utm_source=designernews). I've referenced it a few times over the past few weeks in regard to all creative pursuits in my life. If you're feeling like a fake, this might bring you back from the brink of quitting.

### Wow we did it üëç

‚ú® see u next time ‚ú®
